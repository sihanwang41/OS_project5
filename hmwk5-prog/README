Notes on our implementation:
In our system call, we set the vm_flags to include the VM_RESERVED flag in order to prevent the vmas from being merged.  (In particular, the function merge_vmas does not merge a vma if its vm_flags are VM_SPECIAL, and VM_SPECIAL includes VM_RESERVED.)

In our system call, we ignore pte's that point to 1mb sections per the following Piazza post: https://piazza.com/class/hxmyhj3hhcj16l?cid=442.  To do this, we check the final bit.  This is obviously not architecture independent.

In vm_inspector.c, rather than try to include the page table related kernel macros, we simply defined equivalent versions ourselves.

Please see the written.txt file for the results of our investigation (last part of the HW).


Notes on team collaboration:
We did the vast majority of the coding as a team together in person.  You may notice that most of the commts are under Andrew's name, which is simply because we used his computer when we worked together in person.
