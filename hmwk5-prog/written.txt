We investigated the commonalities between zygote and three other apps: calculator, clock, and Chrome.

Comparing zygote with these apps using cat proc/pid/maps and vm_inspector, we see that the common parts of the page table are all references to system/bin, system/lib, system/framework, and others in the system/ directory.  For virtual addresses in an app corresponding to these data, they map to the same physical address as the corresponding virtual addresses in zygote.  Presumably these data are simply system-level libraries and functionality that all Android apps share.  (We do note that, in some cases, these virtual addresses in the app do not [yet] map to any physical page.  Presumably this is just because the app has not accessed that virtual address yet.)

We also notice some commonalities in the physical addresses *between* apps that are not present in zygote.  Specifically, we see many entries in proc/pid/maps for dev/kgsl.  Using vm_inspector to compare the physical locations of the virtual addresses corresponding to these entries, we see that the physical addresses are the same.  It appears that dev/kgsl is a device driver for OpenGL graphics processing (see citation below) that many apps use; therefore it is not surprising that all of the processes that use it refer to the same physical memory.

The differences between each app and zygote include the .apk binary for the app itself.
